This lecture's github commit:
[17 Saving Race Conditions · UnityRPGv2/RPG@8f9e706](https://github.com/UnityRPGv2/RPG/commit/8f9e70692876f560eff2b9ab5b8fc0835074c6f8)

In general also we thought that `Start()` usually called after the `RestoreState()` 

Because the `RestoreState()` is getting called in `Awake()`. 

```csharp
// SavingSystem.cs
public IEnumerator LoadLastScene(string saveFile)
{
    Dictionary<string, object> state = LoadFile(saveFile);
    int buildIndex = SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex;
    if (state.ContainsKey("lastSceneBuildIndex"))
    {
        buildIndex = (int)state["lastSceneBuildIndex"];
    }
    yield return SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(buildIndex);
    RestoreState(state);
}
```

`yield return SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(buildIndex);` 
when the scene has finished loading and that actually in terms of timeline is after all the `Awakes()` have been called in the scene, but before all the `Start()`. So essentially it's like being called on `Awake()` or just after `Awake()` that we will have **`RestoreState()`**.

However if that isn't the case then it's going to depend when `LoadLastScene()` was called.（但这也要看`LoadLastScene()`这个函数本身是什么时候被调用的）

In `SavingWrapper.cs` , we have got the `LoadLastScene()` is happening inside **`Start()` .**(see below)

```csharp
private IEnumerator Start()
{
    Fader fader = FindObjectOfType<Fader>();
    fader.FadeOutImmediate();
    yield return GetComponent<SavingSystem>().LoadLastScene(defaultSaveFile);
    yield return fader.FadeIn(fadeInTime);
}
```

make sure that `Start()`  is always called after our  state has been restored. 

All of the `IEnumerator` coroutine is going to need to be called in **`Awake()`** instead of `Start()`. (see below)

```csharp
private void Awake()
{
    StartCoroutine(LoadLastScene());
}

private IEnumerator LoadLastScene()
{
    Fader fader = FindObjectOfType<Fader>();
    // make sure fader is instantiate in PersistentObjectSpawner
    while (fader == null)
    {
        print("yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.1f) to make sure fader is instantiate.");
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.1f);
    }

    fader.FadeOutImmediate();
    yield return GetComponent<SavingSystem>().LoadLastScene(defaultSaveFile);
    yield return fader.FadeIn(fadeInTime);
}
```

Summarize in this lecture

- We want our `Start()` and `Restore()` to happen in a predictable order. we want `Restore()` to happen before `Start()`, so that in `Start()` we can rely on the state having been restored.
- Our function called `LoadSceneAsync()` finished or yield returns after everything has been `Awake()`, but before all this `Start()` have been called which is great. because that's what we need in order to have **`RestoreState()`** happen before all the Start()
