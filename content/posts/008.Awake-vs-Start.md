The best practice for registering for callbacks is to do it in `OnEnable()` . But be careful because it means that in `OnEnable()` the same rules go as for `Awake()` : you cannot use any external functions because you don't know their state has been set up yet.

> **OnEnable**: (only called if the Object is active): This function is called just after the object is enabled. This happens when a MonoBehaviour instance is created, such as when a level is loaded or a GameObject with the script component is instantiated. (Called after `Awake()` but before `Start()`)  
>
> Note that for objects added to the scene, the `Awake` and `OnEnable` functions for all scripts will be called before Start, Update, etc are called for any of them. Naturally, this cannot be enforced when an object is instantiated during gameplay.

```csharp
private void OnEnable()
{
    if (experience != null)
    {
        experience.onExperienceGained += UpdateLevel;
    }
}
```

And similar to this which need to do an `OnDisable()` as well as is just good habit. But what could happen is if something disables `BaseStats` , it could continue to get notification from `Experience` when `ExperienceGained()` . And just to prevent that from happening we're going to remove our subscription to this event by using `-=` `OnDisable()`.

> **OnDisable**: This function is called when the behaviour becomes disabled or inactive.

```csharp
private void OnDisable()
{
    if (experience != null)
    {
        experience.onExperienceGained -= UpdateLevel;
    }
}
```
